                <p>In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function f of several variables is the vector field \nabla f whose value at a point p is the vector whose components are the partial derivatives of f at pGradient, in mathematics, a differential operator applied to a three-dimensional vector-valued function to yield a vector whose three components are the partial derivatives of the function with respect to its three variables
